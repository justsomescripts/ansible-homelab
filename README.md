# Ansible Homelab

This repository houses Ansible resources for configuring my personal homelab.
It covers the setup of physical hosts, such as configuring UPS systems and ZFS Event
Daemon with Postfix as an SMTP relay for critical issue notifications, as well as
declarations for virtual machines.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About The Project

This project aims to be completely declarative and able to bootstrap an empty environment
in to use for disaster recovery and initial setup. The roles are written to be re-usable
and independent of the underlying Linux OS family. All roles are used / tested on Debian-based
systems.

Built with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)

## ‚úàÔ∏è Getting Started

The following is necessary to start using this repository:

**Required packages**:

- `ansible`
- `sshpass` (for initial setup)
- `python-passlib`
- `jq`
- `python-jmespath`

**Optional packages**:

- `bitwarden-cli` (for getting secrets)
- `sshpass` (for populating public SSH keys during initial setup)

**Ansible collections**:

- `ansible.builtin`
- `community.general` (for bitwarden lookups)
- `community.proxmox`

**Installation example on Arch (btw)**

The `ansible` package includes all required collections

```bash
sudo pacman --sync ansible sshpass python-passlib jq python-jmespath
```

## üìñ Usage

The Playbooks should be called using the `site.yaml` Playbook. It includes tags
for various combination of steps:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yaml --tags init                 # bootstrap a new environment
ansible-playbook site.yaml --tags init --limit proxmox # bootstrap all proxmox nodes environment
ansible-playbook site.yaml --tags upgrade              # upgrade all systems
```
