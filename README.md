## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About The Project

This project aims to be completely declarative and able to bootstrap an empty environment
in to use for disaster recovery and initial setup. The roles are written to be re-usable
and independent of the underlying Linux OS family. All roles are used / tested on Debian-based
systems.

Built with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)

The Playbooks should be called using the `site.yaml` Playbook. It includes tags
for various combination of steps:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yaml --tags init                 # bootstrap a new environment
ansible-playbook site.yaml --tags init --limit proxmox # bootstrap all proxmox nodes environment
ansible-playbook site.yaml --tags upgrade              # upgrade all systems
```
